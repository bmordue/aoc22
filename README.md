# aoc22

Working project root directory:
1. Run `npm i` to install dependencies, like typescript compiler. (Only needs to be repeated if anything changes in `package.json`).

2. Run `npx tsc` to compile all Typescript files into javascript. Needs to be repeated every time Typescript code is changed.

Working in a "day of advent" directory, eg aoc22/2: run `node 2.js` to execute the compiled JS code and print an answer on the console.
